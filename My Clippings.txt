Obviously, then, the actuality or the formula is different when the matter is different; for in some cases it is the composition, in others the mixing, and in others some other of the attributes we have named. And so, of the people who go in for defining, those who define a house as stones, bricks, and timbers are speaking of the potential house, for these are the matter; but those who propose 'a receptacle to shelter chattels and living beings', or something of the sort, speak of the actuality.

Evidently, then, unity in the strictest sense, if we define it according to the meaning of the word, is a measure, and most properly of quantity, and secondly of quality. And some things will be one if they are indivisible in quantity, and others if they are indivisible in quality; and so that which is one is indivisible, either absolutely or qua one.

austere unity enforces this doubt. Te One does not lend itself to explanations that have many components. We have seen that Plotinus argues against any direct descriptions of it: For if the absolutely partless had to speak itself, it must, frst of all, say what it is not; so that in this way too it would be many in order to be one. Tus when it says “I am this”, if it means something other than itself by “this”, it will be telling a lie; but if it is speaking of some incidental property of itself, it will be saying that it is many or saying “am am” or “I I”.(Plotinus, Enn.V.3.10.33–7 [trans.Armstrong]) In trying to describe something that is absolutely simple, one either breaks it down into parts in one’s speech or repeats, tautologically, its proper nature.Terefore, all descriptions apart from its name are not, ultimately, ftting to an absolute simple unity. Tis idea later gave rise to negative theology: the idea that one can only describe what God is not, not what God is (via apophatica). As we have seen, Plotinus cannot altogether refrain from describing the One, but he insists that these descriptions are, at best, approximations. Many of his followers took the negative way more seriously, trying to, as it were, strip the One of everything unsuitable for its nature. Tere is also an altogether diﬀerent idea about the most propitious way of approaching the One. Let us recall the view of the very late Neoplatonic philosopher Damascius that the One is primarily not an absolute unity, but One-All, a thing that precedes and encloses all diﬀerences. It is not absolute unity but perhaps everything in profound unity. Such a comprehensive One can best be approached by everything it comprehends rather than by stripping it from anything. Te method Damascius suggests is contraction or simplifcation (anaplōsis) of all thoughts into a unity. Since what is sought is something one, something utterly simple, distinctions must be overcome, not by disregarding them but by forging them somehow into unity. Damascius describes this method as melting together all distinctions. Te soul does not ascend to the One by163

Te unavailability of the One for cognition is nicely brought out by a much earlier Neoplatonist, Porphyry, in his analogy of dreaming; it is possible for us to describe to someone else the experiences of a dream we had last night, trying to reveal its salient happenings, phenomenal qualities and the emotional feelings connected to it. Yet only the one who has the dream has a direct comprehension of it; the other must make do with second-hand reports of the peculiarities of that state.Similarly, our normal thinking can only portray the One from a distance (Porphyry, Launching Points to the Intelligible, §25).

For Plotinus, virtue is something appropriate to the realm of sense and action. Te intelligible generates and gives principles to especially higher virtues, but these should not be predicated of the Intellect itself. His pupil transforms the theory of virtue according to the axiom of “each thing in everything but in a manner appropriate to the subject”. Virtue becomes something that exists at all levels of reality. Each level can be predicated on its own particular virtues. Following this axiom leads, naturally, to Iamblichus’ extension of virtues both downwards and upwards. For this frst deeply spiritual thinker of the movement in the third and fourth centuries, they include virtues that even animals may have, as well as theurgic virtues that unite the soul with the highest levels of the metaphysical hierarchy (

For you evil does not exist at all, and not only for you but for your created universe, because there is nothing outside it which could break in and destroy the order which you have imposed upon it. But in the parts of the universe, there are certain elements which are thought evil because of a conflict of interest. These elements are congruous with other elements and as such are good, and are also good in themselves. All these elements which have some mutual conflict of interest are congruous with the inferior part of the universe which we call earth. Its heaven is cloudy and windy, which is fitting for it.

Though Descartes’s rational soul may seem to be the counterpart of the scholastics’ intellect, it in fact works quite differently. It does not abstract from purely sensory representations of external objects, for on Descartes’s theory the senses do not represent objects at all. The senses only receive impacts from surrounding matter: it is the rational soul that represents things, even colours, textures, and temperatures.

Descartes meets this requirement in a particularly thoroughgoing way. He realizes that the concept of mind extends to beings other than humans, but – and this is what I take to be distinctive about his theory – his way of thinking about the mind is consciously divorced from biology, and it is less sensitive to the ways in which the capacities of lower creatures can approximate to human ones than to ways in which our capacities can exist much enhanced in superhuman beings, like angels and God. Indeed, Descartes classifies minds according to the extent of their capacities, and not by reference to the biological species of the beings who have them. Our mind is not so much human as finite; God’s is not so much superhuman as infinite. And for us to have minds just is for us to have capacities of the same general type as God’s, albeit far more limited and constrained than His own. The crucial point is that it is God’s perfect or infinite mind that sets the standard for anything else’s counting as a mind.

I will only say in general that all the objections typically bandied about by the atheists to assail the existence of God always depend either on ascribing human emotions to God, or on arrogantly claiming for our minds such power and wisdom that we attempt to determine and grasp fully what God can and ought to do. Hence these objections will cause us no difficulty, provided we but remember that our minds are to be regarded as finite, while God is to be regarded as incomprehensible and infinite.

Yet to bring this about I will not need to show that all my opinions are false, which is perhaps something I could never accomplish. But reason now persuades me that I should withhold my assent no less carefully from opinions that are not completely certain and indubitable than I would from those that are patently false. For this reason, it will suffice for the rejection of all of these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt. Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task {60} that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.

The sensory qualities of such an object are therefore no more than passing accidents, through which its essence is dimly and confusedly perceived. If we are to know the essence of the wax we must consult not the senses but the intellect, which is alone capable of grasping the essences of things. The only properties that the wax seems to have essentially are extension, flexibility, and movability in space. From this we may conclude that material substances (such as the wax) are essentially extended, and that changes in material substances are changes in their spatial disposition.

For Leibniz, possible but non-existing individuals are just thoughts or ‘ideas’. They have no other kind of existence than mental existence. As such they obviously need a mind thinking them or they would not have any existence at all. Hence, a mind is needed to ground whatever lower degree of reality there is in beings which are possible but do not really exist.

If one grants that there would be eternal, necessary truths about mathematical objects even if no human mind ever thought of them, or even if there were no really existing beings instantiating some geometrical figure, one has to conclude by this reasoning that there must be some other, superior mind which grounds their reality by eternally thinking these objects and their relations. Following a long tradition inspired by Augustine’s Christianized version of Platonism, Leibniz concluded that this mind is the mind of God. God eternally thinks all possible beings, and this is what ultimately grounds the reality of those possible beings which exist only as thoughts or ideas.

To endorse the principle of sufficient reason is to endorse the thoroughgoing intelligibility—that is, rationality—of reality. For Leibniz, ‘no fact could be found to be true or existing, and no proposition to be true, unless there is a sufficient reason’ (Monadology, § 32; GP VI, 612). In other words, there are no brute, or unexplainable, facts; there is no ultimate, ground-floor irrationality from which things spring randomly. No matter how unreasonable, inexplicable, or chancy things may appear to us, there is an explanation of why they are the way they are. All facts are the result of an infinite chain of reasons which connects everything with everything else, even if, due to this very infinity, it is not possible for us to follow or discover these reasons.

This conception of contingency, however, turns out to be significantly thinner than even the above rescue operation might, at first glance, suggest. Although it is not logically or metaphysically necessary for God to create the possible world which, as a matter of fact, he creates, it turns out that, for Leibniz, it is morally necessary. It is morally (as opposed to logically or metaphysically) necessary for the wise to choose the best. To use an analogy, although it is not strictly impossible for a loving and wise mother, who is also well aware of what she is doing, intentionally to harm her child gravely and purely for fun (that is, although she has the power to do such a thing), this action is morally impossible (as long as she remains loving and wise). God, being supremely good and supremely wise, could not (morally speaking) create any world but the best of all possible worlds.

The issue with which Leibniz is grappling would be called, in modern parlance, the issue of ‘ontological grounding’. The physical world requires some further ‘grounding’, that is, it is necessary to postulate some further entity or principle as the condition of this very world as we experience it. Without the postulation of this condition, this world is not intelligible, that is to say, we are not explaining why it is the way it is. In brief, metaphysical entities and principles provide the ultimate grounding of the entities and principles studied by physics.

In sum, Leibniz declares at various points throughout his life that the adoption of mechanism is not incompatible with elements of Aristotelian metaphysics properly understood. Embracing the traditional insight that a substance must be endowed with intrinsic unity and activity, he devises his own version of this view, pointing at our own mind as the paradigmatic example of what it is to be a substance, namely an entity one per se which is the source of its own internal activity. In March 1690 he writes to Arnauld: ‘The body is an aggregate of substances, and, properly speaking, it is not a substance. As a consequence, everywhere in the body there must be indivisible, ingenerable, and incorruptible substances which have something which corresponds to souls; [and it must be] that all these substances have always been and will always be united to organic bodies’ (GP II, 135–6).

If there cannot be indivisible extended entities which can ground composites, but indivisible entities are a requisite of that which is composed, the only alternative is to postulate indivisible entities which are not extended. Insofar as matter is conceived as extended, these entities are also to be conceived as not material. Simple, immaterial, non-extended, indivisible entities are the condition of the existence of composed, material, extended, divisible entities. The world of extended bodies studied by physics is ultimately intelligible only if we postulate metaphysical entities which must exist in order for those extended bodies to exist, at least in the minimal sense of being ‘something’ (whatever that is) as opposed to nothing. Whatever reality extended bodies have, it is borrowed from ‘what is genuinely a real unity’ (A III, 4, 451; WF 57) and hence ‘truly one being’ (A II, 2, 186). Call them monads or ‘unities’.

To summarize, there are three clearly distinct senses of matter for Leibniz: primary matter, secondary matter, and extended matter. By ‘primary matter’ is meant the primitive aspect of passivity of a (created) simple substance or monad. Secondary matter is an aggregate of monads which constitutes the body of a dominant monad. Extended (or ‘Cartesian’) matter is a phenomenon expressing the way in which aggregates of monads appear to us.

Here Leibniz revisits claims already made, namely that if we had no distinct perceptions then we would be stupefied (M21), and that this is the state of bare monads, which have no distinct perceptions (M20). Leibniz has now effectively defined a state of unconsciousness as one in which a monad has only little perceptions, that is, no distinct ones.

Although Leibniz calls these notions innate, this does not mean that we are born knowing them. Rather, because their source is one’s own self, which exists from the moment of birth onwards (and indeed, from the moment of creation onwards), the notions are always in us virtually, that is, potentially, waiting to be discovered, once we start looking inwards.

Since the time of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a priori has been taken to mean ‘non-empirically’ or ‘independently of experience’, and a posteriori has been taken to mean ‘empirically’ or ‘through experience’. But in Leibniz’s day, the terms had different meanings. This is apparent enough from a famous seventeenth-century logic textbook, the Port Royal Logic, which explains that discovering and comprehending truths is done in two ways: ‘either by proving effects through their causes, which is called demonstrating a priori, or by demonstrating, on the contrary, causes through their effects, which is called proving a posteriori’.

That God produces all other monads is taken to follow from M46, inasmuch as their existence is contingent, and therefore depends upon God’s will. In an earlier draft of M47 Leibniz described God as ‘the primitive simple substance or monad’, but ultimately changed it to ‘the primitive unity, or original simple substance’ in the final copy. However, elsewhere he does identify God as a monad, or primitive monad:

Given that he believes his theory has been demonstrated, it might seem odd that he should refer to it as a ‘hypothesis’, but in Leibniz’s day the French term ‘hypothese’ not only meant ‘hypothesis’ (in the sense of an unproved theory which fits the facts) but also ‘system’ (in the sense of a set of principles and doctrines which one uses to explain phenomena), and it is in this sense that Leibniz uses the term in M59.

As noted earlier, Leibniz’s position in the Monadology is that a compound ‘is nothing but an accumulation or aggregate of simples’ (M2), where an aggregate is understood not as a mere grouping or cluster of simples, but as a grouping or cluster of simples which are united, or aggregated, by a mind, on the basis of the connections between them.

Leibniz, however, takes it to refer to something with infinitely structured organs, for example in PNG3 he states that a body is organic ‘when it forms a kind of automaton or natural machine, which is a machine not only as a whole, but also in its smallest observable parts’. In other words, a body is organic when it has organs, and its parts have organs, and their parts have organs, and so on ad infinitum.

Hence his argument that bodies are always organic is designed to show that bodies have such infinitely nested organisation. The argument itself is not straightforward. It starts with Leibniz noting that every monad represents the universe (established in M56), and then claiming that the universe is regulated in a perfect order, which in all likelihood is an allusion to Leibniz’s view (established in M57) that the universe consists of an infinite series of monads, each of which differs from every other in terms of perception and therefore perfection. Because of the representative nature of both soul and body, the order inherent in this infinite series will be reproduced not just in the perceptions of each soul (established in M60), but also in the structure of each body, which therefore itself has a nested organisation, in the sense of being ordered in each of its infinite parts. And this of course makes it organic.

A second reason Leibniz sometimes offers for his rejection of disembodied souls is based on the need for order and harmony. Souls are connected not just to their own bodies but to everything else, since the least change in one body ripples through to affect all of the others (see M62ff); the end result is a perfect order between all the parts of the created universe.

He followed Malebranche in envisioning all living things as being nested inside each other at the moment of creation, like Russian dolls, such that all animals (men included) that were to develop throughout the course of the universe were present as animalcules in the semen of all previous generations of animals. Aside from the evidence from microscopists, Leibniz also found support for preformationism in the Bible; the theory, he claimed, ‘is sufficiently in accordance with Holy Scriptures, which insinuate that seeds have existed from the beginning’.

The doctrine holds that God so established things from the very beginning that the states of the body and the states of the soul are always in harmony, and are so entirely as a result of body and soul following their own laws rather than because there is any interaction between them, or because one is constantly adjusted to the other by an outside agency (such as God). The soul follows its own psychical laws, while bodies follow the laws of motion, and together these laws ensure agreement between soul and body.

Hence at the moment that the psychical laws operating on Pete’s soul lead him to decide to raise his hand, the laws of motion at work on his body make his hand rise. Similarly, when the laws of motion lead to an object hitting Pete’s leg, the psychical laws bring about in his soul a feeling of pain. By way of illustration, Leibniz sometimes used the example of two clocks. Suppose a sufficiently skilled clockmaker makes two clocks which both keep perfect time of their own accord: their agreement is thus due to the supreme artisanship of the clockmaker at the outset, rather than to any influence between the clocks, or on account of any intervention of the clockmaker.

No local governor of the later transition, no Rex of Vandal, Goth, Hun, Frank or Berber or Moor troop ever dreamt of such a thing. He might fight another local Rex to get part of his taxing-power or his treasure. He might take part in the great religious quarrels (as in Africa) and act tyrannically against a dissident majority, but to fight against the Empire as such or to attempt conquest and rule over a "subject population" would have meant nothing to him; in theory the Empire was still under one control.

The overall structure of an ancient biography can usually be broken down into three main parts—the birth, public life, and death of the person—with the bulk of the book being devoted to the subject’s public career:

If the Gospels were written after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, then why don’t the writers emphasize that Jesus’s prophecy had been fulfilled? That would be the natural thing to do. In fact, that is exactly what Luke does in the Acts of the Apostles with regard to another prophecy that was actually fulfilled before his book was written: Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius. (Acts 11:27-28)

Second, and equally important, the prophecy also declares that this future Messiah will be “cut off”—a common Hebrew expression for being put to death.19 This is where Jesus appears to derive the idea that the Son of Man must be put to death. As I have argued elsewhere in more detail, Jesus is treating the Son of Man in Daniel 7 and the Messiah in Daniel 9 as if they were the same person: the first prophecy describes the heavenly enthronement of the Messiah; the second describes the earthly suffering and death of the Messiah.20 Third and finally, the prophecy links the death of the future Messiah to the destruction of the “city” of Jerusalem and the Temple “sanctuary,” resulting in the end of sacrifice and a mysterious “abomination” that “makes desolate” (Daniel 9:27). Significantly, Jesus elsewhere explicitly refers to this passage from Daniel when he warns the disciples about the coming of the “abomination of desolation” and the destruction of Jerusalem (see Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14).

Over and over again, the Old Testament emphasizes how the God of the universe displays his power by controlling two of the most powerful forces in creation: the wind and the sea.9 For example, in the book of Job, God shows his might when at his “rebuke” and “by his power” he “stilled the sea” (Job 26:11-12). Likewise, the book of Psalms shows how “great” the LORD is by declaring that he has power over the “winds” and that he “rebuked” the “waters” of the sea when he made the world (Psalm 104:1-7). Along similar lines, the God of Israel revealed his “mighty power” when he “rebuked the Red Sea” in the exodus from Egypt (Psalm 106:8-9). Finally, and most striking of all, Psalm 107 describes the LORD as having the power to save his people by stilling a storm and calming the waves of the sea:

In short: the reason Jesus does not repeatedly and explicitly proclaim himself to be the Messiah is also the reason Jesus does not repeatedly and explicitly proclaim himself to be divine.

By juxtaposing the traditional scribal title for the Messiah with David’s reference to “my Lord” in Psalm 110, Jesus is saying that, according to Scripture, the Messiah is more than just the descendant of David.

Third and finally, Jesus ends by telling the rich young man that the “one thing” he still lacks is to sell all he has and follow him. This ending is essential for unlocking the riddle of his words. Yet it is constantly overlooked by those who claim Jesus is denying that he is God. After making his declaration about the goodness of God, Jesus does something stunning: he adds a command to follow him to the obligation to keep the Ten Commandments. In a first-century Jewish context, this would have been shocking. In Jewish Scripture, the Ten Commandments are written by the very “finger of God” (Exodus 31:18). Yet here is Jesus adding the command to follow him as if that was on par with keeping the commandments.32

the reaction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin confirms the divine implications of Jesus’s answer. Caiaphas immediately tears his garments and declares Jesus guilty of “blasphemy” (Matthew 26:65; Mark 14:63). Strikingly, this is precisely the same reaction described in early rabbinic literature when someone blasphemes against God by pronouncing the divine name: “the judges stand up on their feet and rend their garments” (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7.5). Not surprisingly, the Sanhedrin condemns Jesus to “death” (Matthew 26:66; Mark 14:64). Recall once again that simply claiming to be the Messiah was not blasphemy.17 But if Jesus is claiming to be a divine Messiah who will be seated on a heavenly throne (like God) and come in on the clouds of heaven (also like God), then the charge of blasphemy makes sense.

To be specific, Jesus is quoting the first line of Psalm 22, which begins: A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer; and by night, but find no rest.

Although scholars continue to debate exactly how to translate the Hebrew expression for the “piercing” of his “hands and feet” (Psalm 22:16), the ancient Greek Septuagint—the oldest Jewish translation of the Hebrew Scriptures we possess—clearly states: “They have gouged my hands and feet” (Psalm 21:17 LXX).31 At the very least, these lines from the psalm describe the mockery, persecution, and execution of the suffering psalmist. Yet none of these things ever happened to David. But by quoting this particular psalm in his final moments, Jesus is identifying the sufferings described in the psalm with his own passion and death on the cross.

Things were done, as they had to be done for some practical purpose, in the simplest way. The bread and wine were brought when the moment came at which they were wanted, the lessons were read in a loud voice from a convenient place whence they could be heard, and everyone sat down to listen. Only we may naturally suppose that things were done decently and reverently, that gradually and inevitably signs of respect were made. All ritual grew naturally out of these purely practical actions, just as vestments evolved out of ordinary dress.

We must then conceive the ante-nicene liturgy as a uniform type, still fluid and liable to change in its details. Gradually more and more of these details are fixed. They become customs and are kept as the tradition of the Church, for nothing is so conservative as liturgical instinct; but the whole rite is still more or less fluid, within a fixed outline. Out of this primitive fluid rite, by insistence on one detail in one place, on another somewhere else, by enlarging or shortening different parts in different Churches, the parent-rites, and then again, derived from them, all the old liturgies of Christendom are derived.

It seems certain that one reason, perhaps the chief, for the rearrangement of our Canon was the omission (apparently for dogmatic reasons) of the Invocation of the Holy Ghost (Epiklesis). Its absence in the Roman Mass is unique. All Eastern rites have an Epiklesis, the Gallican Mass had one. The origin of our Canon is still the burning question among liturgical students.

but would not such a recasting of the arrangement as Drews supposes best account for this tradition? Why was the change made? Obviously to assimilate the Roman rite with that of Alexandria. At Alexandria the Intercession comes before the Consecration. The Roman Intercession, or rather its greater part, was moved to conform with that. Drews points out the alliance between Rome and Alexandria (against Antioch and Constantinople) in the Vth century, and lastly suggests the influence of John Talaia, Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, who was a friend of Gelasius and spent many years of exile at Rome, as causing the change.

The prayers said at the foot of the altar are in their present form the latest part of all. They developed out of mediaeval private preparations and were not formally appointed in their present state before the missal of Pius V (1570). The Gloria was introduced gradually, at first only to be sung on feasts at bishops’ Masses. It is probably Gallican. The Creed came to Rome in the XIth century.

So excited was Alcuin that he could write in extravagant terms to Charlemagne about the heights of civilization that he believed were in reach: If many are infected by your aims, a new Athens will be created in France, nay, an Athens finer than the old, for ours, ennobled by the teachings of Christ, will surpass all the wisdom of the Academy. The old had only the disciplines of Plato for teacher and yet inspired by the seven liberal arts it still shone with splendor: but ours will be endowed besides with the sevenfold plenitude of the Holy Ghost and will outshine all the dignity of secular wisdom.11

One of the brightest lights of the early stage of recovery was Gerbert of Aurillac, who later became Pope Sylvester II (r. 999–1003). Gerbert was certainly the most learned man in the Europe of his day. He was renowned for the breadth of his knowledge, which encompassed astronomy, Latin literature, mathematics, music, philosophy, and theology. His thirst for ancient manuscripts calls to mind the enthusiasm of the fifteenth century, when the Church offered rewards to humanist scholars who recovered ancient texts.

Honored as it was, the copyist’s task was difficult and demanding. Inscribed on one monastic manuscript are the words, “He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labor; but though three fingers only hold the pen, the whole body grows weary.” The monks often had to work through the most punishing cold. A monastic copyist, imploring our sympathy upon completing a copy of Saint Jerome’s commentary on the Book of Daniel, wrote: “Good readers who may use this work, do not, I pray you, forget him who copied it: it was a poor brother named Louis, who, while he transcribed this volume, brought from a foreign country, endured the cold, and was obliged to finish in the night what he was not able to write by daylight.

What they actually taught was more subtle. They believed that Aristotle’s views, such as the eternity of the earth, were the certain results of sound reasoning, and that no fault could be found in the logical process that led to them. Yet these views contradicted divine revelation. The Latin Averroists solved the problem by arguing that as philosophers they had to follow the dictates of reason wherever they led, but that since the conclusions they reached contradicted revelation, they could not be true in any absolute sense. After all, what was feeble human reason against the omnipotence of God, who transcended it?52

That class of large landowners which already existed and controlled, as I have said, anything from a quarter to a third of the agricultural values of England, were too strong for the monarchy.

The first of these strains arises from the divergence between the moral theories upon which the State reposes and the social facts which those moral theories attempt to govern. The second strain arises from the insecurity to which Capitalism condemns the great mass of society, and the general character of anxiety and peril which it imposes upon all citizens, but in particular upon the majority, which consists, under Capitalism, of dispossessed free men.

If the vehicle fails to reach its destination, we change vehicles. We substitute, add, or subtract words to make the Bible sound normal. We change idioms to be more familiar. We turn God’s names into generic terms of divinity. We fiddle with the Bible’s rhetoric so that it fits our rhetoric, rather than letting the Bible’s rhetoric shape ours. Once we think we have found the spirit of the text, we feel free to mold the letter as we will.

He claimed that natural religion could be reduced to five points: there is a supreme God, he should be worshipped, virtue and piety are the central forms of worship, we must turn from evil, and there are rewards and punishments after this life.41 For most freethinkers, this was the original monotheistic faith. Over time, self-interested priests corrupted this simple religion of moral goodness by introducing ceremonies, superstitions, sacrifices, and dogmas, and then inserting themselves between God and men as mediators. Priestcraft was the great corrupter of religion. Though Jesus came to restore natural religion, Christianity too has been corrupted by priests. Meanwhile, the natural religion of reason has been preserved by philosophers, but in secret for fear of the priests.42

For Kant, religion is rational; therefore, like Spinoza, he knew that religion is “moral.” For Kant, true rational religion must be natural rather than particular and positive.44 Though he withholds the crucial definition of religion to the end of his treatise, he assumes the definition from the beginning: religion is accepting the demands of practical reason as if they were the demands of God.

Readers cannot shed their own prejudices, strip off the clothing of intervening history, and embrace the author naked, as it were. Readers inhabit a particular time, are heirs to a particular history, share in a particular cultural tradition. No reader ever approaches any text in complete innocence, with a blank slate. We come to a text in our native language with a prior knowledge of that language, at least the language as used by our contemporaries. We also have certain preconceptions and prejudices23 concerning all sorts of things: the nature of reality, the value of texts, the way the world works, what words mean, what beauty is, and so on and on. Many of these prejudices may be unconscious, but they exist nonetheless. Many of them may be false or misleading, but many may be quite accurate. The Enlightenment ideal of complete emancipation from prejudice is illusory.

Reading Hosea in the light of the event of Jesus is, in principle, just as ordinary as reading Darwin in the light of Nazism, The Descent of Man in the light of Mein Kampf. The event of Darwin’s text becomes a different event, with a new meaning, in the aftermath of Nazism.

First, Jesus is taken to Jerusalem, where he appears before the high priest on the mountains of the city. The location of Pilate’s praetorium is uncertain, but it was certainly in the high districts of the city. As the soldiers mock Jesus, they parody a coronation scene, fixing a crown and a robe on Jesus and honoring him with “Hail” (19:1-3). At the climax of the trial scene, Jesus is brought to Gabbatha, a high place, an elevated platform where he appears in his ironic splendor as king of the Jews. The elevation continues as he is nailed to a cross and lifted up from the earth. John surely knows that not every one of his Greek readers will grasp the force of Gabbatha, but he places it there as one more hint that Jesus’ trial, despite the appearances, is not a humiliation but an elevation. It is the lifting up of the Son of Man.

Gunpowder obviously changed the face of war, but this set off a chain reaction that had far-reaching social, political, economic, and architectural consequences. Gunpowder equalized warfare, so that an indifferently trained commoner could fight as effectively as a highly trained and richly equipped knight. That, in turn, pulled out one of the central props holding up the aristocracy’s social position—if they were not specialists in war, what exactly was the basis for all the social privileges they enjoyed? An aristocracy of refinement replaced the medieval aristocracy of military prowess. Castles built in the old style could not withstand cannonballs, and one result was that brickmaking became big business. Theodore Rabb makes a very compelling case for this scenario,23 but nowhere does he cite a piece of conclusive documentation supporting his hypothesis. Nowhere is there a document that laments how the world has changed since the introduction of gunpowder.

When we get to John 15–16, the blind man’s story line is generalized. Jesus warns the Twelve in the Upper Room Discourse that the world will hate, persecute, and reject the disciples as they have done to Jesus (15:18-24). As the disciples bear witness to the One with whom they have been “from the beginning” (15:27), the world will become more intensely hostile, and will go so far as to “make you outcasts from the synagogue” and to kill disciples of Jesus (16:1-2). All this will take place after Jesus has gone away from them with a promise to return (14:1-4). What Jesus describes is exactly what happens to the blind man: Jesus “goes away” and is nowhere to be found; the Jews mount an assault on the blind man; he witnesses faithfully; they cast him out of the synagogue; and there, Jesus “returns” to him, not leaving him an orphan. In the light of John 15–16, the story of the blind man ceases to mean merely “this is what happened to a blind man” and comes to mean “this is what happens to everyone who comes to the light.”

What differentiates John’s ocularcentrism from the philosophical ocularcentrism of the early modern period is the specific focus on Jesus. The Logos that brings light is not, as in Descartes or Kant, a human rationality, but the living word who proceeds from the Father and is equal to the Father, the Word that became flesh. Enlightenment, for John, does not come through the process of doubt or through reflection on the transcendental prerequisites for human reason. Enlightenment comes from the light source: the Word that is with the Father from the beginning, the light who lightens every man. Jesus is the light of the world, and the enlightened ones are those who cling to him in faith.

A new ethical literature, beginning with the Ethics of Peter Abelard (c.1139), the work which introduced the word to the Latin West, moved the focus from the consequences of actions to the actor’s inward intentions, engaging with the secular world and stressing personal responsibility: God thinks not of what is done but in what mind it may be done, and the merit or glory of the doer lies in the intention, not in the deed.

Whereas Cicero had offered the defnition that it was a body of people united by an equality of justice, Augustine rejected this as unrealizable in a sinful world.Instead, Augustine proposed his own defnition: Where there is a multitude of people, joined together in a common enjoyment of what they truly love, there may ftly be said to be a people.

The Holy Cross guild of Stratford-upon-Avon, much of whose membership was drawn from the town and its immediate hinterland, comprised in addition still more numerous adherents from a wide scatter of market villages. Prominent among these were local centres of the butchering, leather, and textile trades which were important in Stratford’s own economy: Chipping Camden and Shipston-on-Stour to the south, Bromsgrove, Redditch, King’s Norton, and Feckenham to the north. 112 Guild membership gave these outsiders a personal connection, identity, and role within Stratford when they came there to trade.

To begin with, it is to be noted that the modern conception of a self-contained and self-sufficient universe is certainly incompatible with the metaphysical teachings of Christianity. It is not enough to say that the cosmos has been created by God and to maintain that thenceforth it exists by itself and moves by its own energies and in accordance with its own laws: surely the relationship between God and world is far more subtle than that! One may put it this way: God is not only transcendent, but He is immanent as well. Thus, on the one hand, God transcends the cosmos: He resides beyond the confines of space, 'in unapproachable light' as St Paul declares; and yet, at the same time, He abides in all places and penetrates into the innermost recesses of every existent thing. If God did not abide in the cosmos, moreover, the cosmos would forthwith cease to exist. As St Thomas Aquinas observes, 'since God is the universal cause of all being, in whatever region being can be found, there must be the divine presence.

But by and large they are not; and from the start, this has proved to be a major stumbling block for the protagonists of evolution. As the matter stood in 1859-and even more as it stands today-fossils do not make friendly witnesses for the evolutionist. Darwin himself, moreover, has perceived this very clearly. Thus, in The Origin of Species, he declares that 'this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory.' Repeatedly he raises the crucial question: 'Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?' And his answer is this: 'The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.'2 This, clearly, is the critical point-now as then-which the evolutionist needs to establish. 'He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record,' writes Darwin, 'will rightly reject the whole theory.

UNLIKE OTHER SCIENTIFIC THEORIES, which enable one to predict previously unknown facts, and which can therefore be tested in a more or less cogent manner, the doctrine of evolution has virtually no predictive content. Basically, one, argues in behalf of the evolutionist contention simply by adducing known facts which the theory purports to explain (frequently, as we have seen, with the aid of other hypotheses, which have been introduced specifically for this purpose). Now it is clear that such an argument derives whatever ·cogency it may have from an auxiliary premise to the effect that the given phenomena cannot be explained equally well on any other reasonable basis. But this obviously poses a fundamental problem: just how does one decide whether a conceivable alternative is reasonable? Is it reasonable, for example, to postulate some form of teleological causation? Or is it reasonable to view the matter in a metaphysical or theological perspective? In practice, to be admissible in the eyes of the scientific community, an alternative must evidently accord with the prevailing Weltanschauung

Modern physics has taught us: wrote Planck in 1929, 'that the nature of any system cannot be discovered by dividing it into its component parts and studying each part by itself, since such a method often implies the loss of important properties of the system.'36 And as one moves from inorganic to living structures, this principle assumes a position of paramount importance. Thus, in the biological domain, one arrives in fact at the very antithesis of the mechanistic hypothesis: here it is not the whole that derives from the parts, but it is the parts, rather, that derive their existence (as parts) from the given whole

The fact is that for all but a discerning few it has undermined and discredited a cosmic symbolism which had nurtured mankind throughout the ages. Gone was the visible exemplification of higher realms and the vivid sense of verticality which spoke of transcendence and of the spiritual quest. Gone was the world that had inspired Dante to compose his masterpiece.

Men have conceived not only of elves, but they have imagined gods, and worshipped them, even worshipped those most deformed by their authors' own evil. But they have made false gods out of other materials: their notions, their banners, their monies; even their sciences and their social and economic theories have demanded human sacrifice. Abusus non tollit usum. Fantasy remains a human right: we make in our measure and in our derivative mode, because we are made: and not only made, but made in the image and likeness of a Maker.

The consolation of fairy-stories, the joy of the happy ending: or more correctly of the good catastrophe, the sudden joyous “turn” (for there is no true end to any fairy-tale):36 this joy, which is one of the things which fairy-stories can produce supremely well, is not essentially “escapist,” nor “fugitive.” In its fairy-tale—or otherworld—setting, it is a sudden and miraculous grace: never to be counted on to recur. It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance; it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief.

The Gospels contain a fairy-story, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. They contain many marvels—peculiarly artistic,41 beautiful, and moving: “mythical” in their perfect, self-contained significance; and among the marvels is the greatest and most complete conceivable eucatastrophe. But this story has entered History and the primary world; the desire and aspiration of sub-creation has been raised to the fulfillment of Creation. The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man's history. The Resurrection is the eucatastrophe of the story of the Incarnation. This story begins and ends in joy. It has pre-eminently the “inner consistency of reality.” There is no tale ever told that men would rather find was true, and none which so many sceptical men have accepted as true on its own merits.

So great is the bounty with which he has been treated that he may now, perhaps, fairly dare to guess that in Fantasy he may actually assist in the effoliation and multiple enrichment of creation.

In Chapter 3 (“What is Reality?”) Hawking explores the scientific implications of model-dependent realism. He begins by contrast ing Ptolemaic geocentrism with Copernican heliocentrism, and concludes that “Although it is not uncommon for people to say that Copernicus proved Ptolemy wrong, that is not true.”(41) The point is that “one can use either picture as a model of the universe”; it is only that the ”the equations of motion are much simpler in the frame of reference in which the sun is at rest.” (42) And this brings us to the central premise: “There is no picture- or theory-independent concept of reality.” It is to be noted that this seemingly innocuous notion has profound implications; for it means that a scientific theory is not a description of an independently-existing reality (as scientists and laymen alike had thought), but a “model” that defines reality

Darwinian explanations are unlikely to be adequate, not just for some particular structures but for general features of life.

The task of deciding whether random processes produced things like intricate paintings on walls of the city buildings (perhaps by blowing sand) is pretty easy. After all, elegant paintings aren’t very likely to be made by chance processes, especially if the paintings portray not just simple geometric patterns, but images of people or animals.

On average, for humans to achieve a mutation like this by chance, we would need to wait a hundred million times ten million years.

Since a purely materialist explanation cannot do this, the materialist version of evolutionary theory cannot be the whole truth. Organisms such as ourselves do not just happen to be conscious; therefore no explanation even of the physical character of those organisms can be adequate which is not also an explanation of their mental character.

Antirealism of this kind is a more serious option for the moral than for the scientific case. One can intelligibly hold that moral realism is implausible because evolutionary theory is the best current explanation of our faculties, and an evolutionary account cannot be given of how we would be able to discover judgment-independent moral truth, if there were such a thing.1 But it would be awkward to abandon scientific realism for analogous reasons, because one would then have to become an antirealist about evolutionary theory as well. This would mean that evolutionary theory is inconsistent with scientific realism and cannot be understood realistically, which seems an excessively strong result. There would be something strange to the point of incoherence about taking scientific naturalism as the ground for antirealism about natural science.

It was the first Tetrarchy, a "rule of four." Two did not quite work; four would do the trick.

Zosimus's account is chronologically impossible, since it dates Constantine's conversion more than a decade after the emperor had begun to identify himself publicly with Christianity. Zosimus's history was published in a Latin translation in the late sixteenth century and was reprinted in its original Greek in the following century. It has had some influence on the image of Constantine. Without following Zosimus, many modern scholars have dismissed the Eusebian story.

Changing standards announced a change of loyalty from one divine patron to another.

For the ancients generally, war was no exercise of sheer power, no secular Realpolitik. War involved bloodshed, and bloodshed was always hedged about with ritualized taboos.

If Constantine was motivated only by policy, he was one of the most monstrous political cynics of all time. Monstrously cynical, and politically inept cynicism to boot: his expressions of revulsion at paganism might be calculated political maneuvers to win over the bishops, but in winning the support of Christians he would risk offending some 90 percent of the population of the empire. The "evil genius" explanation does not work. He might have been evil, but if so he was dumb, a "useful idiot" whose strings were pulled by the bishops.

There was no need, after all, in either east or west, to decree toleration for Christians. As soon as Constantine was acclaimed as Augustus of the West at York in 306, he ended the persecution of Christians. Maxentius granted freedom to Christians in Rome and Italy during his six years of rule there. Constantine and Licinius did meet at Milan in 313, they did discuss the imperial policy toward Christianity and religion in general, and they did arrive at a common policy, which is expressed in two letters jointly signed by the two Augusti, one a Latin letter posted in Nicomedia in June 313 and the other a slightly different Greek version posted in Caesarea some time later.'

Constantine did not prohibit child exposure, but in an edict of 318 sent to the vicarius of Africa, he undermined the legal foundation of the practice: Whoever, secretly or openly, shall hasten the death of a parent, or son or other near relative, whose murder is accounted as parricide, will suffer the penalty of parricide.

Slaves were welcomed into the church, and some rose to positions of leadership. The church thus offered opportunities for upward mobility. "Among us," Lactantius wrote, "there is no slave and we call them all brothers in the spirit and, as to religion, fellow slaves .1130

Doing something pleasing to God on Sunday was particularly appropriate, and manumission was one of those pleasing acts. Manumission was endorsed as an act of "piety," and Constantine encouraged anyone who wished to perform this act to turn to the church to do it. "This is the first time in history that emancipation is praised as godly work and encouraged by an emperor." In fact, Constantine's endorsement of manumission went further than that of most Christian writers of the time. Though not requiring manumission, Constantine did encourage it, and for that there was no "model" in the early church.34

Canon law was far from perfect, but it set a standard of justice that civil rulers were exhorted to emulate and that founded the Western legal tradition until recently, when the religious foundations of Western law have been severely eroded.

Civil law cannot be religiously neutral. It cannot serve Jesus and Jupiter, God and Mammon. It will either love the one and hate the other, or hate the one and love the other. It is a good thing if the law is not organized, as Roman law was, to favor the wealthy and powerful. It is a good thing if the mechanisms and procedures of civil law are modified to make it possible for the injured to find redress and vindication. Indeed, it is an act of neighbor love-love of an enemy, even-for a Christian king to issue an edict opening up episcopal courts to Jews and pagans as well as Christians.

the opposition that existed was in some measure circumstantial, based on the fact that the Roman army demanded sharing in religious liturgies that Christians refused; and once military service could be pursued without participating in idolatry, many Christians found military service a legitimate life for a Christian disciple.

heretics-the great missionaries of Yoder and Heilke's narrative-typically converted barbarians in precisely the same way. Visigoths "converted to Arianism when settled as Federates in Moesia between 382 and 395," and the Burgundians likewise "converted when settled as Federates in Germania Prima between 412 and 436." In 476, small Christian communities were scattered throughout northern and eastern Europe, but "none of the great Germanic peoples living outside the frontier was Christian."30 A Constantinian "merger" of faith and empire seems to have been a most effective evangelistic method during the fourth and fifth centuries.

Should fourth-century Christians, like the Jews, have rejoiced in the king's confession of the God of heaven? They did. Should they, like Daniel and Joseph and Mordecai, have served in the imperial administration? They did. Should they, like Ezra and Nehemiah, have gratefully accepted the king's largesse, which helped them build magnificent places of worship? They did. Should they, like Joseph and Daniel, have witnessed to the truth even in the face of enticements, threats and imperial fury? The best of them did. Should they, like Daniel, have acknowledged that God, not the emperor, controlled history and that God's people, not Babylon or Rome, was the secret center of the world? Nearly all of them did. Should they have recognized that the church has its own power and does not need to be bound to the sword to carry on its mission? Most of them did.

As Eusebius recounted the story, Constantine seemed to believe there was a basic incompatibility between being an emperor and being a Christian, between court and church, warfare and prayer, the purple and the white. It would be an ironic conclusion: Constantine, the first anti-Constantinian. Constantine the Yoderian.

There was blood there too, but it was the blood of Jesus that announced the end of bloodshed. The church too was a sacrificial city, the true city of sacrifice, the city of final sacrifice, which in its Eucharistic liturgy of sacrifice announced the end of animal sacrifice and the initiation of a new sacrificial order.

The point is that the story of Scripture is not a story of increasing passivity but of increasing participation in the activity of the ever-active God. We are being raised as kings to fight alongside our elder Brother in service to our Father. Finally, we might make an argument from greater to lesser: if the Lord lets Christians wield the most powerful of spiritual weapons, does he not expect us to be able to handle lesser weapons? If he has handed us a broadsword, does he not assume we know how to use a penknife?

Totalitarian states attack the sacrificial city of the church, seeking to turn it into Diocletian's sacrifice of Christians. Democratic states more or less peacefully marginalize the church, and the Christians of democratic states too often cheer them on. For all their differences, totalitarian and democratic systems are secretly united in their anti-Constantinianism.

Baptism sets a new trajectory, initiates a new beginning, but every beginning is the beginning of something. Through Constantine, Rome was baptized into a world without animal sacrifice and officially recognized the true sacrificial city, the one community that does offer a foretaste of the final kingdom. Christian Rome was in its infancy, but that was hardly surprising. All baptisms are infant baptisms.

The considerations are not a mere speculative study; they are not made in order to learn or to know, but to inflame the heart, and set the will in motion. The mind's eye is fixed upon some truth in order to believe it, upon some virtue in order to love and seek it, upon some duty to fulfil it, upon moral evil to detest and fly from it, upon some danger to avoid it. In a word, meditation ought to lead to love and to action.
